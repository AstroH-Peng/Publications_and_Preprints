> In this paper, the recently developed machine learning (ML) approach to improve orbit prediction accuracy has been systematically investigated using three ML algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and Gaussian processes (GP). In a simulation environment consisting of orbit propagation, measurement, estimation, and prediction processes, totally 12 resident space objects (RSOs) in SSO, LEO and MEO are simulated to compare the performance of three ML algorithms. The results in this paper show that ANN usually has the best approximation capability but is easiest to overfit data; SVM is least likely to overfit but the performance usually cannot surpass ANN and GP. Additionally, the ML approach with all the three algorithms is observed to be robust with respect to the measurement noise.

> A machine learning (ML) approach has been recently proposed to improve orbit prediction accuracy of resident space objects (RSOs) through learning from historical data. 
Previous results have shown that the ML approach can successfully improve the point estimation accuracy. 
This paper extends the ML approach by introducing Gaussian Processes (GPs) which can generate uncertainty information about its point estimate. 
Both the simulation environment and the publicly available RSO catalogs are used to test the advanced ML approach. 
Numerical results demonstrate that the trained GP model can effectively improve the orbit prediction accuracy and generate uncertainty boundaries with high performance. 
Discussions and insights are also presented during the investigation using real data, including suggestions on designing learning variables and the possible causes for some unsatisfying results. 

[3] [Peng, H., Bai, X., 2018. Machine Learning Approach to Improve Satellite Orbit Prediction Accuracy: Validation Using Publicly Available Data **(accepted)**. The Journal of the Astronautical Sciences.](preprints\Peng_Bai_Machine_2019)
> Efficient and high precision orbit prediction is increasingly crucial for improved Space Situational Awareness. 
Due to the lack of the required information such as space environment conditions and characteristics of Resident Space Objects (RSOs), satellite collisions have happened, partially because that the solely physics-based approaches can fail to achieve the required accuracy for collision avoidance. 
With the hypothesis that a Machine Learning (ML) approach can learn the underlying pattern of the orbit prediction errors from historical data, in this paper, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is explored for improving the orbit prediction accuracy. 
Two publicly available Two-Line Element (TLE) catalog and International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) catalog are used to validate the proposed ML approach. 
The position and velocity components of 11 total RSOs maintained at both catalogs are studied. 
Results of the study demonstrate that the designed dataset structure and SVM model can improve the orbit prediction accuracy with good performance on most cases. 
The performance on RSOs belonging to different orbit types is analyzed using different sizes of training and testing data. 
Results of the paper demonstrate the potential of using the proposed ML approach to improve the accuracy of TLE catalog.
